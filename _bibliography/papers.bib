  author={Gokul Subramanian and Kripa Iyer},
  abstract={The process of gender and age classification of facial images has been studied extensively in the field of machine learning and computer vision. In this report, we present our work on classification of facial images to predict the gender and age of the person in the image. The methods that we have tried include PCA+SVM, KNN, and Adaboost.},

  title={(Upenn MEAM 620 final project) An analytical approach for decoupling the orientation planner
and the Cartesian position planner for the PR2 end effector},
  author={Gokul R. Subramanian and Maxim Likhachev},
  abstract={This paper discusses an analytical approach for decoupling the orientation planner from the Cartesian position planner for the PR2 end effector. The main goals are improvement in performance and robustness without loss of completeness. To accomplish this, we employ basic 3 dimensional spatial geometric formulations. We show how this method has advantages over traditional planning methods. Solution using our method takes time in the order of microseconds. We believe that these results can be generalized for application to other robot systems as well, especially in the field of robotic object manipulation.},

  title={Probabilistic analysis of some sequence and graph algorithms},
  author={Gokul Subramanian},
  abstract={Algorithms are often compared either experimentally or by their theoretical worst case asymptotic behavior. The problem with the former method is that the results of testing on certain inputs might not imply the overall characteristics of the algorithm(s) over the entire input space. And the latter method is too pessimistic about the performance of algorithms. A more realisitic approach to comparing algorithms is to analyse their average case asymptotic behavior. The definition of average (or mean or expected value) is based on an assumed probability distribution over the input space. This can be tricky and lead to a very complicated analysis. However, in some cases, a fairly reasonable probability distribution evidently stands out. This incomplete survey attemps to describe the average case analysis of a variety of algoritms. We will cover commonly used algorithms from the two domains. (a) Sequence algorithms: Searching ordered arrays, Sorting, Selection and Hashing, and (b) Graph algorithms: Minimum Spanning Trees, Shortest paths and Bipartite matching. For each problem, we will give a short description of the problem and then proceed to describe the various algorithms and their corresponding analyses for that problem. All these algorithms are used both as an end in themselves, and as subroutines in other more complicated algorithms. Karp [9] presents an extensive bibliography of probabilistic analyses.

  title={Planning for Manipulation with Adaptive Motion Primitives},
  author={Benjamin Cohen and Gokul Subramanian and Sachin Chitta and Maxim Likhachev},
  abstract={In this paper, we present a search-based motion planning algorithm for manipulation that handles the high dimensionality of the problem and minimizes the limitations associated with employing a strict set of pre-defined actions. Our approach employs a set of adaptive motion primitives comprised of static motions with variable dimensionality and on-the-fly motions generated by two analytical solvers. This method results in a slimmer, multi-dimensional lattice and offers the ability to satisfy goal constraints with precision. To validate our approach, we used a 7DOF manipulator to perform experiments on a real mobile manipulation platform (Willow Garage's PR2). Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the planner in efficiently navigating cluttered spaces; the method generates consistent, low-cost motion trajectories, and guarantees the search is complete with bounds on the suboptimality of the solution.},

  title={Impersonating request-based security in a connection-based security environment},
  author={Gokul Ramanan Subramanian and Sayantan Chakravorty and Dennis Tighe and Carlos Alessandro Chiconato and Damian Wylie},
  abstract={A connection-based service impersonates request-based security for requests from clients that do not include credentials for the requests (e.g., data plane requests made via a connection-oriented security). A connection between a client and a connection-based service is established based on connection credentials that are based on security credentials from a request-based security service. The credentials are sent by a security component of the service to a local agent of the remote security service to be authenticated by the security service. An impersonation token is returned by the security service and cached by the local agent. Requests from the client to perform operations do not include credentials. For each request, the service passes an identifier for the client and the operation to a local authorization component that calls the agent for authorization of the requested operation. The agent uses the impersonation token to obtain authorization for the requested operation.},
