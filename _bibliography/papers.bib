  title={Planning for Manipulation with Adaptive Motion Primitives},
  author={Benjamin Cohen and Gokul Subramanian and Sachin Chitta and Maxim Likhachev},
  abstract={In this paper, we present a search-based motion planning algorithm for manipulation that handles the high dimensionality of the problem and minimizes the limitations associated with employing a strict set of pre-defined actions. Our approach employs a set of adaptive motion primitives comprised of static motions with variable dimensionality and on-the-fly motions generated by two analytical solvers. This method results in a slimmer, multi-dimensional lattice and offers the ability to satisfy goal constraints with precision. To validate our approach, we used a 7DOF manipulator to perform experiments on a real mobile manipulation platform (Willow Garage's PR2). Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the planner in efficiently navigating cluttered spaces; the method generates consistent, low-cost motion trajectories, and guarantees the search is complete with bounds on the suboptimality of the solution.},

  title={Impersonating request-based security in a connection-based security environment},
  author={Gokul Ramanan Subramanian and Sayantan Chakravorty and Dennis Tighe and Carlos Alessandro Chiconato and Damian Wylie},
  abstract={A connection-based service impersonates request-based security for requests from clients that do not include credentials for the requests (e.g., data plane requests made via a connection-oriented security). A connection between a client and a connection-based service is established based on connection credentials that are based on security credentials from a request-based security service. The credentials are sent by a security component of the service to a local agent of the remote security service to be authenticated by the security service. An impersonation token is returned by the security service and cached by the local agent. Requests from the client to perform operations do not include credentials. For each request, the service passes an identifier for the client and the operation to a local authorization component that calls the agent for authorization of the requested operation. The agent uses the impersonation token to obtain authorization for the requested operation.},
