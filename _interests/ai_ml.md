In 2024, it is practically criminal to not know anything about Artificial Intelligence (AI) / Machine Learning (ML). My first encounter with ML was in 2010 when I did the excellent course by the late <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Taskar">Prof. Ben Taskar</a> at the University of Pennsylvania. I got loads of experience writing ML algorithms in Matlab, and scored an _A_ in that course. Since then, I have been focused mostly on building distributed systems, and not as focused on AI / ML. However, I'm trying to get back into this field given its relevance in recent times.

Here is the study plan I'm currently on to review AI / ML foundations.

<ul>
    <li>Read up free books on Linear Algebra by <a href="http://linear.ups.edu/download/fcla-3.50-tablet.pdf">Robert Beezer</a> and <a href="https://hefferon.net/linearalgebra/">Jim Hefferon</a></li>
    <li>Go through the high-level introductions to various AI / ML algorithms by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@SerranoAcademy">Serrano Academy on YouTube</a>, which I found were quite approachable.</li>
    <li>Watch the <a href="https://youtu.be/VMj-3S1tku0?si=-jXvBaS5Tg_ITlTf">YouTube course by Andrej Karpathy</a> on deep learning</li>
    <li>Reads some select papers from the <a href="https://github.com/aimerou/awesome-ai-papers">AI reading list</a></li>
</ul>
