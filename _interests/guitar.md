My interest in playing the guitar started in 2008, when I was doing my undergraduate studies in India. Since then, I have been playing the guitar on and off as a personal hobby. Later during the years 2009-2012, when I was doing my graduate studies in the USA, I joined the Indian classic fusion student music group named Penn Sargam.

In order to make my practice sessions more structured, in 2023, I wrote a <a href="https://github.com/grsubramanian/guitar-patterns">tool</a> that generates chord and scale shapes for any uniformly fretted instrument for any musical system. Of course, this helps with the guitar, but in particular, this is invaluable for me because I don't play in standard tuning. Most recently, I've been playing with the Indian tuning, wherein my strings are tuned to (DADADA).

In the future, I intend to create YouTube videos of me playing Indian classic music on my fretless electric guitar. Stay tuned.
