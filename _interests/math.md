While math has always been interesting, my curiosity in math got rekindled in 2024 while I was trying to help my nephew solve some problems related to the math olympiad qualifiers in India. I enjoy subjects such as algorithms, logic and computability, number theory and combinatorics.

Most recently, I learned about and got somewhat proficient in <a href="https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/tla.html">TLA+</a>, which allows us to abstractly model our programs and assert on their invariants. I'm looking forward to opportunities to use this in an actual industry-scale system.
