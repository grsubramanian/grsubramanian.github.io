Go is an ancient 2-player strategy board game invented in China over 2500 years ago. My interest in this game was piqued while working at Google, when Sundar Pichai announced during a Google IO conference that DeepMind had built an AI (based on Monte-Carlo tree search) to beat the world's best Go player.

I have been playing Go since 2017 and have reached a European rank of 2 dan. See <a href="https://www.europeangodatabase.eu/EGD/Player_Card.php?&key=18650368">here</a> for my game records. I am part of the <a href="https://www.britgo.org">British Go Association</a>, and also the <a href="https://aigp.org.in">Indian Go Association</a>, where I regularly conduct knowledge sharing sessions.
