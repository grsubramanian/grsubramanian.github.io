I am a principal software engineer with experience spanning SaaS, cloud, data backups, data streaming, AI, digital advertising, finance and robotics. I obtained my Masters degree in Robotics and Computer science from the University of Pennsylvania in 2012.

I enjoy all aspects of backend software engineering, including working with customers and product managers to solidify requirements, setting the technical direction of the team/org, designing large-scale systems, writing bar-raising code, operating services, and mentoring people.

For the last 2 years, I have been working with the AWS serverless stack, programming in Golang. For around 7 years before that, I used Java primarily, with a little bit of Python and C++ as required. Language is not a barrier for me - I'm open to programming in any language - in fact, I enjoy learning a new language every few years.

I live in Cambridge, UK with my wife and son. In my spare time, I read up on AI / ML and distributed systems, solve random math problems, play Indian classical music on a fretless guitar, and indulge in the ancient strategy board game Go.
