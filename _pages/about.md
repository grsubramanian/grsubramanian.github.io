I am a principal software engineer with 11 years of experience spanning SaaS, backups, data streaming, cloud, AI, digital advertising, finance and robotics. I obtained by Masters degree in Robotics and Computer science from the University of Pennsylvania in 2012. See my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gokul-ramanan-subramanian-30b4b018">LinkedIn profile</a> for some more details about the work I have been doing.

I enjoy all aspects of backend software engineering, including working with customers and product managers to solidify requirements, setting the technical direction of the team/org, designing large-scale systems, writing bar-raising code, operating services, and mentoring people.

I live in Cambridge, UK with my wife and son. In my spare time, I read up on AI / ML and distributed systems, solve random math problems, play Indian classical music on a fretless guitar, and indulge in the ancient strategy board game Go.
