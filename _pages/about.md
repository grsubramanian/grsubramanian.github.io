I am a software engineering leader with experience spanning a range of diverse fields such as SaaS, cloud, data backups, data streaming, AI, digital advertising, finance and robotics.

I enjoy solving hard problems that have real impact, whether that involves writing code, or great documents, or delivering through others. When working in teams, I find important areas that no one is working on, and focus on those. You could call me a gap filler.

I live in Cambridge, UK with my wife and son. In my spare time, I read up on AI / ML and distributed systems, solve random math problems, play Indian classical music on a fretless guitar, and indulge in the ancient strategy board game Go.

I obtained my Masters degree in Robotics and Computer science from the University of Pennsylvania in 2012.
