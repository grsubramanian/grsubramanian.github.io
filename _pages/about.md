This website is still WIP. Don't yet rely on the contents. I will remove this disclaimer when it is fully done.

I am a principal-level software engineer with 11 years of experience spanning SaaS, backups, data streaming, cloud, AI, digital advertising, finance and robotics. I love mathematics, computer science, music and Go (the game).

This blog captures aspects not covered in my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gokul-ramanan-subramanian-30b4b018).
