I am a principal software engineer with 11 years of experience spanning SaaS, backups, data streaming, cloud, AI, digital advertising, finance and robotics. I obtained by Masters degree in Robotics and Computer science from the University of Pennsylvania in 2012.

I enjoy all aspects of backend software engineering, including working with product managers to solidify requirements, setting the technical direction of the team/org, designing large-scale systems, writing bar-raising code, and mentoring people.

I live in Cambridge, UK with my wife and son. In my spare time, I solve random math problems, play Indian classical music on a fretless guitar, and indulge in the ancient strategy board game Go.
